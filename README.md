# Weather-App

### INTRO
Weather-App is mini-project that uses **Openweather-API** to fetch the weather details using html,css and vanilla javascript.



### API(Application Programming Interface)
An application programming interface(API) is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. 

In layman's terms, API is the messenger that takes your **request** (i.e. the data you ask for) and fetches you **response** (the data you receive).

In this case, our request is taken by **Openweather-API** for weather details such as temperature,humidity,etc. and we get the details for the city we enter.
